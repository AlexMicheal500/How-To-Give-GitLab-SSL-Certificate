	cd /etc/gitlab/
	nano gitlab.rb
Then copy:
letsencrypt['enable'] = true                      # GitLab 10.5 and 10.6 require this option
external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"         # Must use https protocol
letsencrypt['contact_emails'] = ['foo@email.com'] # Optional

Copy the above into gitlab.rb and remove external url present in the file formerly present.
